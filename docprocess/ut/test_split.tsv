David Nevin ROCHESTER, NY 14621 US ------------------------------ Email 1,637 ------------------------------ From: sanderswbw To:   xxxxxxxx Date: 4/24/2014 12:48 Subject: Do Not End Net Neutrality To: Chairman Wheeler and the rest of the Federal Communications Commission, I worked for many years in the telecommunications industry during the 1990s, as the industry innovated and grew. I worked in companies large and small that built the infrastructure to meet the surging demand for access to the Internet. Eventually I worked for a media content start-up that could never have launched were it not for net neutrality. The same conditions and requirements for open access exist today - and even if they didn't, conditions of democracy still do demand that open, unfettered access be maintained and strengthened.
